# Trade bot design

## Functional outline

### Initialization

1. At launch, list all "transitioning orders".
(Transitioning are `sending` or `cancelling`, but confirmation not received. There might have been a crash)
    * Update to their actual status, either `Inactive` if they did not make it to Binance, or `Active`.

2. For each `Active` order:
    * If it fulfilled, complete the order.
    * If it is still live, cancel the order.

3. Delete all `Inactive` orders.
    * Also remove all fragments associated with the `Inactive` orders.

4. Get the current rate.
    * Issue separate `BUY` **market** orders for all `BUY` constituants with target rates **above** current, grouped by target rate.
    * Issue separate `SELL` **market** orders for all `SELL` constituants with target rates **below** current, grouped by target rate.
    * Invoke fulfill callbacks, to distribute counter-order constituants.

   **Important**: The counter order will still be computed from the original target rates, not the actual fulfill rate.


#### Finding outstanding orders

List all rates for which there are fragments in the group of interest (GROUP BY `targetRate`)

  * Filter on `direction`.
  * Filter on > or < `targetRate`.
  * Fragments which are `Inactive` (or not associated to any order).

#### Placing orders

For each rate:

  1. Create a new `Inactive` order in DB, get the `order id`.

  2. Assign all matching fragments to this `order id`.

  3. Sum all fragments amounts assigned to this order, and update `order amount`.

  4. Mark the order `Sending`.

  5. Send the order via binance API.

  6. Upon confirmation:

    * mark the order `Active`.
    * record the order creation time.
    * record the `exchange id`.

#### Completing order

a. Spawn fragments (counter orders).

b. Mark the order `Fulfilled`.

#### Cancelling order

a. Mark the order `Cancelling`.

b. Cancel the order vian binance API.

c.  Upon confirmation:

  1. Remove all fragments association.

  2. Mark the order `Inactive`.

  3. Delete order from database.

### Main loop (2 orders active at the same time)

5. Place the `SELL` and `BUY` around the current rate.
  They emit *events* upon fulfilling.
  **Note**: This is the only moment the two active orders will be direct neighbors on the "rate scale".

6. Upon *fulfill event*:
    * Distribute resulting counter-order fragments, and complete order.
    * Cancel the other active order.
    * Place a `SELL` order at the rate step immediately **above** the fulfill rate.
    * Place a `BUY` order at the rate step immediately **below** the fulfill rate.
    * Start again at next *fulfill event*.


## Reminders

Use decimals not floats

Fix a minimal order amount that makes sense. Take a look at the relation to "nominal" values.

Cut the space of rate as "change proportional" small ranges

Accumulate the orders for each value, at least while they are not posted as order on binance

Throttle when the server response with a back-off, but keep on reading successful orders to accumulate

The "order emitter" must be aware of the current rate:
* To send orders that are in the hot zone (because the zone moved, or because a new order was added in the current zone). Also cancel orders that get too far out from the hot zone?
* To sell (buy) at market every order that is below (above) the current rate. BUT keep track of the initial order rate, so we do no deplete a zone. This will be useful for both "back-off" and "bot was turned-off for some time" situations.

How to address websocket 24h transition (risk of missing an order fulfil maybe?) This is a more generic problem in case of crash, some orders might be missed: should it only be checked at launch though?

Handle 400 errors (such as 400 Client error -1021 "Timestamp for this request is outside of the recvWindow."). Probably retrying.

Mark all constituants as done once their order is fulfilled.


## Data model

Order
+ Client ID
+ Creation time
+ Direction (Buy / Sell)
+ Pair
+ Amount
+ Fulfill times (can be composed of several trades...)
+ Fulfill callback (the function that specifies the counter orders)
+ Status (Sending, Confirmed, Cancelling, Fulfilled)
+ Broker id (to match against Binance records)

Only in DB?
+ Constituants -> vector< pair<origin-order, amount> >
+ Fulfill spread ->  vector< pair<counter-order, amount> >
+ Fulfill taken-home (the amount taken out of the trade pool, into a wallet)
+ Fulfill rate
+ target rate (to be redeployed to the correct target rate in the live map of orders)


Permanent storage:
Orders active and inactive
